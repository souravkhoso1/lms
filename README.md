# Software Engineering Project 
Leave Management System | Developed for IIT Jodhpur as Software Engineering Semester Project

# Description
We have created a web-based application to do leave management. PHP based MVC framework CodeIgniter was used to develop it. 

 
# Steps to use
 - Install XAMPP (for [Windows](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/5.5.33/xampp-win32-5.5.33-0-VC11-installer.exe), [Linux 32 bit](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/5.5.33/xampp-linux-5.5.33-0-installer.run), [Linux 64 bit](https://www.apachefriends.org/xampp-files/5.5.33/xampp-linux-x64-5.5.33-0-installer.run)). It is free to download.
 - Download 'leave' folder and place all of its content to <xampp installation directory>/htdocs/leave
 - Start XAMPP control panel and open 'http://localhost/phpmyadmin' in browser. Please don't put any password to XAMPP installation otherwise things will be very complicated.
 - Create a new database named 'leave'.
 - Import 'leave.sql' to this new 'leave' database. Use the default settings.
 - Open 'http://localhost/leave' and explore the functionalities of LMS.
